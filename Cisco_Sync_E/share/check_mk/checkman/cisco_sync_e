description:
 The check searches for the Sync-E interfaces (type 3) and compares this number at each check interval. 

 The signal quality is then analysed. 

 Information such as priority etc. is then output in the details. 

 In the setup you can set how many Sync-E interfaces there should be (default 2), the status when the number of interfaces changes (default {WARN}) and the status when the active interface has changed (default {CRIT}).


discovery:
 One service is created for each Cisco device.
